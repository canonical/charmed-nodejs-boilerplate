# Dependency Management Lock Files (for other package managers, if not using Bun exclusively)
# If you are using Bun, you might not have these, but include them for safety.
# It's generally recommended to commit package-lock.json or yarn.lock for reproducible builds.
# If you stick strictly to Bun, you can remove these.
